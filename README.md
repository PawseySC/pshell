owner: Sean Fleming (sean.fleming@pawsey.org.au)

* Thin client library for interacting with a Mediaflux server
* Requires Python 2.7


### How do I get set up? ###

Simply import the mfclient module in your code to start developing a client that can communicate with a Mediaflux server.


### How do I run the tests? ###

The test_mfclient.py code serves as a basic example of how to use the mfclient module.

Run it once to generate a template file ~/.mf_config which you will need to edit to suit your Mediaflux server.

Run it again to execute the basic test suite.


### Command line clients - under development ###

pshell.py - python only command line client 

* Tab completion
* SFTP-like syntax
