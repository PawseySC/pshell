### Current

Just use build_release -> zip source bundle and require users to install >= python 3.6 on whatever platform they're on

Users will separately have to install boto3 if they want the S3 functionality.

Can't bundle boto3 in a python zip: https://github.com/boto/boto3/issues/1770

This should then work:

python3 pshell


### Docker

docker build -t pshell .
docker run -it --rm pshell
