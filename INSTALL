### Create binary installer for windows (tested against miniconda)

python setup.py bdist --formats=wininst

dist/pshell-1.0.macosx-10.6-intel.exe 

FIXME - this works, but does not connect to a python installation (if python is missing)

pyinstaller in a docker container might be the way to go ...



### Testing


Removing pshell from installed software doesn't stop pshell running ... arrgh - FIXME - removing miniconda as well to totally nuke the system


Setup

1. get miniconda -> 64 bit windows installer -> defaults

2. run pshell-dist.exe installer

3. menu -> all apps -> Anaconda -> Anaconda prompt

c:\> python -m pshell

c:\> pawsey:offline>
